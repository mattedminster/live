/**

 * Due to how OpenLayers works, we cannot make the Redux store the single source

 * view is visible, the view manages its own center, zoom level and rotation,
 * and dispatches actions to update the stored center, zoom level and rotation
 * in the store whenever the user finished moving the map. When the map view
 * is not visible, the Redux store is the source of the truth. When the map view
 * is mounted for the first time, it is initialized from the state of the store.
